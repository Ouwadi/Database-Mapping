# Database-Mapping
The objective of this project was to reduce discrepancies in sales data between two customer databases managed by separate teams.
The script leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to match customer site details by evaluating the similarity of predefined criteria, including site name, address, and postal code proximity.
